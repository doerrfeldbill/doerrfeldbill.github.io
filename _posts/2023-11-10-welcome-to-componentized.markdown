At Kubecon + Cloudnativecon 2023, I was struck by the passion and excitement surrounding WebAssembly (abbreviated as Wasm). Although I have been familiar with the technology for some time, I sense the industry is finally waking up to how revolutionary it truly is.

I was told Wasm would "forever change the way software is built." I was told it enables portability, language-agnosticism, cloud-agnosticism, and bank-grade security isolation. *Were these people drinking some Wasm-flavored Kool-aid, or were they for real?*

I went on to interview a handful of experts at the event — essentially anyone I could find involved in Wasm in any way. I talked to lead maintainers working on the Wasm runtime. I spoke with two developers who had been banging their heads on the wall trying to complete a protocol to enable the creation of Wasm component registries. Another Wasm evangelist beautifully described how Wasm brings us closer to the original fundamental ideals of 20th-century software engineering theorists.

Wasm is hopping out of the browser, too — Sony reps showed me how they just put Wasm on a chip to help run AI on the edge. I was also told that the Component Model, the next generation of Wasm, an ongoing effort, will be extremely intriguing, enabling far more use cases and providing greater extensibility.

The day after the event, I snagged this domain. And now, what you see before you is a barebones site. It's generated with Jekyll and hosted as GitHub Pages. I have big plans for Compontentized.io and hope to expand this presence as my understanding of this fascinating, albeit technical, subject matures.

I sense a lot of growth potential in this area. I want to shine a brighter light on this space and its ardent contributors, who have been working diligently but have yet to realize the potential of the technology. 

Many roadblocks prevent the more widespread adoption of Wasm. However, I believe they are surmountable. So, a goal of Compontentized.io is to address these issues and offer potential solutions.
