The Wasm blog. Tracking the Cambrian explosion of development around WebAssembly. This site is intended to be a vendor-neutral territory to encourage thought leadership and coverage of everything Wasm and component-based modular architecture. 

This site is still a proof of concept and will hopefully be expanded in time. The Editor of Compontentized.io is [Bill Doerrfeld](https://www.doerrfeld.io/), an independent tech journalist.
